# HTML Preset Creator
HTML Preset Creator (HTMLP PC for short) is a free and open source program that helps speed up the creation of web pages from a template.

## Features  
- Saving preset to .hpc file which can be opened with HTML PC.
- Exporting presets to HTML as long as you have enough storage.
- Change the page's Title, CSS File path and JS File path in the General Settings tab.


You can set-up a preset in the program, then save the preset as a custom .hpc file which you can open with HTML PC, or you can export it as an HTML File from your preset than you can add the content of the page.

Here's an example:
Let's say you have made a super duper cool header / footer for a website that you are making but you want to have it for every page of your website but dont want to copy + paste it every time, this is where this program comes handy. You can input the Header code (without header tag) in the Header tab, same for the Footer but with the footer tag. Now you in the General Settings tab you can change some settings like the webpage's name, CSS file path and JS file path. You can also add some informations regarding the preset (will not be saved with the HTML export).
